A Brooklyn man could spend as many as 18 years in prison after being convicted of stealing three Brooklyn properties by forging deeds, as well as pretending to be an attorney, and attempting to sell properties he didn’t actually own.According to Thompson’s office, Smith did that by forging and backdating a deed to the property.According to testimony given during Smith’s trial, Smith stole 45 Lewis Avenue, a lot in Bedford-Stuyvesant, by filing a backdated deed containing the forged signature of a man who bought the lot in 1999. And now he will spend many years in prison where scammers like him belong.”Smith then sold the lot twice: in March 2011 to the owner of an adjacent laundromat for $12,000 and in April 2011 to another man for $11,000.
