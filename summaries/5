Senate Bill 1150 is expected to be voted on next Monday by the California Assembly Committee on Banking and Finance.After hearing from advocates like HERA, federal regulators provided guidance to servicers on how to help these surviving homeowners.Stories from surviving homeowners would make the worst bureaucrat blush.This ability for homeowners to sue for violations was also included in the Homeowner Bill of Rights, a bill the industry also opposed, predicting economic ruin if it passed.Californiaâ€™s Homeowner Bill of Rights went into effect in 2013 and stopped mortgage servicers from engaging in abusive practices that were leading to unnecessary foreclosures on families throughout California.
