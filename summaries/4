According to the 2014 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, 42% of FHA borrowers earn greater than the area median income (AMI).According to analysts from Compass Point Research & Trading, the noise surrounding another cut in mortgage insurance premiums is getting louder.The FHA should do the same to ensure it stays squarely focused on the households with the greatest need.In November Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky and Amy DeBone said that the probability of a further FHA rate cut was 20%, but according to a new report from those same analysts, the likelihood of a further cut to FHA premiums is significantly higher now than it was in November.But before these rumored cuts can ever come into fruition, Sinks urges the industry to identify the FHA’s role fully before modifying the MIP structure.
