The panel noted that the district court required the defendant to pay slightly more than $2 million of the more-than-$50 million in losses caused by the conspiracy in which she participated.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in Beecroftâ€™s favor, at least in part, tossing out the $107 forfeiture claim, but upholding the other penalties against her.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the scheme included 450 straw buyer transactions involving approximately 227 properties with a total purchase price of more than $107 million.The panel held that the district court did not err in calculating the proceeds of her criminal activity when imposing the order of money forfeiture.According to court documents, Beecroft participated in the scheme for years, participating in the scheme with Grimm even before his wife did.
