This week HousingWire launched a new award program, HW Insiders, aimed at recognizing the key players in every company who are vital to that company's success, but may not be well-known in the larger industry.The HW Insiders replaces the Fast50, a list we were very much attached to, but one that required companies to divulge year-over-year financials â€” something many private companies were understandably reluctant to do.We are incredibly excited about this program and can't wait to unveil it in our September issue of HousingWire Magazine!We've opened up the nomination period, which runs through the end of June, and look forward to meeting the inaugural Insiders group.It's a program for those in U.S. mortgage lending, servicing, investing and real estate who are doing stellar work.
